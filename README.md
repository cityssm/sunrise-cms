🚧 **In development** 🚧

**A web-based application to assist cemetery managers with managing their cemetery records.**

This is a major refactoring of the now archived
[Lot Occupancy System](https://github.com/cityssm/lot-occupancy-system),
originally built with multiple focuses in mind. This fork completely reworks the project
to focus exculsively on cemetery management.

## Why Sunrise CMS?

### ✔️ Cemetery Maps are NOT Required

Many cemetery applications rely on maps to drill down into burial sites.
In Sunrise CMS, maps are completely optional, greatly reducing the effort needed to get started,
and reducing the maintenance work when new blocks of burial sites are introduced.

### ✔️ The System Requirements are Very Low

Sunrise CMS does not need an expensive server to run.
No separate database server is required either.
The whole application could run on a current, modest workstation.

### ✔️ Track Unlimited Cemeteries, Unlimited Burial Sites, Unlimited Contracts...

There are no limits to the number of records that can be tracked in Sunrise CMS.

### ✔️ Includes a Simple Built-In Work Order System

In addition to tracking data related to cemetery plots,
Sunrise CMS can also track work order activities, like interments and grave maintenance.

### ✔️ Sunrise CMS is Free and Open Source

There's no cost to use it.

Although the system is quite niche, it's being released in an open source environment in hopes to pool developer resources from other municipalities looking to move away from older, legacy systems.

It is being shared to start the dialog among other municipalities and present an option to those who may be looking to refresh their own cemetery systems.
