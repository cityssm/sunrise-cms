# âœ… Funeral Director Suggestions Feature - Implementation Checklist

## Core Requirements âœ“
- [x] **AJAX Integration**: Retrieve funeral directors when funeral home is selected
- [x] **Datalist Suggestions**: Use HTML5 datalist for autocomplete functionality  
- [x] **Database Query**: Get recently used directors from other contracts with same funeral home
- [x] **Performance**: Pre-load suggestions for existing contracts to save AJAX calls

## Technical Implementation âœ“
- [x] **Database Function**: `getFuneralDirectorsByFuneralHomeId()` with proper filtering
- [x] **AJAX Endpoint**: `POST /contracts/doGetFuneralDirectors` with validation
- [x] **Route Configuration**: Added to contracts router with proper middleware
- [x] **Template Updates**: Modified contract-edit.ejs with datalist and JavaScript
- [x] **Handler Updates**: Both edit and new handlers support the feature

## Data Quality & Performance âœ“
- [x] **Filter Deleted Records**: `recordDelete_timeMillis IS NULL`
- [x] **Filter Empty Names**: `funeralDirectorName IS NOT NULL AND trim(funeralDirectorName) != ''`
- [x] **Usage-Based Ordering**: `ORDER BY usageCount DESC, funeralDirectorName`
- [x] **Limit Results**: `LIMIT 20` for performance
- [x] **Database Efficiency**: Uses existing indexes on funeralHomeId

## User Experience âœ“
- [x] **Non-Intrusive**: Suggestions enhance but don't interfere with manual entry
- [x] **Cross-Browser**: HTML5 datalist works in all modern browsers
- [x] **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation if AJAX fails
- [x] **Real-Time**: Suggestions load immediately when funeral home changes

## Code Quality âœ“
- [x] **TypeScript Types**: Proper interfaces for FuneralDirectorSuggestion
- [x] **Error Handling**: Try-catch blocks and proper HTTP status codes
- [x] **Code Consistency**: Follows existing codebase patterns
- [x] **Permissions**: Protected by existing contract update permissions

## Testing & Validation âœ“
- [x] **SQL Logic**: Validated query returns expected results
- [x] **JavaScript**: Confirmed AJAX calls are triggered correctly
- [x] **UI Functionality**: Screenshots show datalist working as expected
- [x] **Edge Cases**: Handles empty funeral home, non-existent IDs, etc.

## Documentation âœ“
- [x] **Code Comments**: Clear documentation in all files
- [x] **Feature Documentation**: Comprehensive README created
- [x] **SQL Validation**: Test file shows expected query behavior
- [x] **Demo**: Visual demonstration of functionality
